# SlideAI
This project implements a solver for the classic 3x3 sliding block puzzle using different search algorithms, including A* (with Manhattan distance as the heuristic function), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Bidirectional BFS, Depth-First Search (DFS), and Iterative Deepening DFS (IDDFS). The solution includes an interactive Python-based interface with visualization of puzzle states and playback of solution steps.

Capable of solving the toughest sliding block puzzle configurations (e.g., the hardest 3x3 puzzle state) in less than a minute, producing an optimal solution in just 31 moves.
